# Parallel Execution Safety

Reference for architect Step 4 (parallelization decision).

## Conflict Risk Classification Table

| Risk Level | Condition | Example | Judgment |
|------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Critical** | Same file modified directly | Two agents modify `layout.tsx` | **Sequential required** |
| **High** | Shared component/type/state modified simultaneously | A modifies `Button`, B uses `Button` | **Sequential recommended** |
| **Medium** | DB schema, routing, config files | Adding migration + modifying entity | **Shared files first, then parallel** |
| **Low** | Import chain (indirect dependency) | A modifies util, B uses that util | **Parallel possible (with caution)** |
| **None** | Completely independent files | Implementing separate API endpoints | **Parallel safe** |

## Parallel Safety Checklist

All 5 must be Yes for parallel to be safe:

1. No overlap in files to be modified
2. Shared types/interfaces not modified simultaneously
3. Shared state (Store) not modified simultaneously
4. Config files not modified simultaneously
5. API contract (interface) pre-defined or not modified

If any is No: proceed sequentially, or handle shared files first (partial-parallel).

## Parallel Execution Summary (plan.md format)

Include in plan.md when execution mode is `partial-parallel` or `parallel`:

```markdown
## Parallel Execution Summary

**Pattern:** [describe parallel structure]

| Session | Branch | Plan File | Skill(s) | File Scope |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Current | feat/x-frontend | plan-frontend.md | frontend-dev, ui-publish | app/, components/ |
| Additional | feat/x-backend | plan-backend.md | backend-dev | server/, api/ |

**Conflict risk:** [None/Low/Medium]
**Checklist:** [n/5 passed]
**Reasoning:** [brief justification]
```

## Merge Coordination Rule

When `planner-lite` sessions merge in parallel mode:

1. Never hardcode `main`; merge only to each file's `Branch`
2. Planners with different `Branch` values may run concurrently
3. Planners with the same `Branch` must be orchestrated sequentially
